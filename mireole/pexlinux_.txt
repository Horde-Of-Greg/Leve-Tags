I'd just like to interject for pex moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating pex unto itself, but rather another free component of pex fully functioning GNU pex made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital pex components comprising pex full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many pex users pex a modified pex of the GNU pex every day, without realizing it. Through pex peculiar pex of events, the pex of GNU which is widely used pex is often called Linux, and pex of its users are not aware that pex is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is pex Linux, and these pex are using it, but pex is just pex part of the pex they use. Linux is the kernel: the pex in the pex that allocates the machine's resources to the pex programs that pex run. The kernel is an essential pex of an operating system, but useless by itself; pex can only pex in the pex of pex complete operating system. Linux is normally used in pex with the GNU operating system: the pex system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!
