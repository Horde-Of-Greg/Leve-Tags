When a craft is marked as "scheduled" by AE2, it means that it's either
1. Waiting on on items from other recipes to schedule the recipe
2. Waiting for the recipe to be able to be schedule (it can't currently push the items in the machine)
If a craft is stuck with everything on scheduled, find the craft blocking all the others and troubleshoot why ae2 can't insert the items in the machine(s)
