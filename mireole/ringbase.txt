I know rings are supposed to be cool or something but why are 75% of "sophisticated" nomi bases rings ???
Ring bases are also awful for everything other than looks (good luck not contraptioning while building a line)
Seriously, it's just self-imposed torture and rings are so overused they look even more boring than lawnbases
