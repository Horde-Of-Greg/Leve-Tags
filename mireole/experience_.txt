I have written several walls of text regarding my experience with Haskell in various unrelated places and I still more or less haven't gotten any softer towards it. I'd rather use Java than Haskell. I'd rather use fucking x64 assembler than Haskell. I'd rather drag my tongue across the log as it comes out of skunk's ass.
