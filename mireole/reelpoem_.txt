Was it all just a dream
The memories we had
The adventures we had
Was it just us creating false memories
To convince the mind
To convince the soul
That our existencr had a meaning
What if our erasure is meaningless
What if our disappearance is meaningless
What are we in this existence
Are we to serve
Are we to love
Or are we to be
To be an example
To be a model
None of that matters, for we reel
