As I sweep the final mine, excitement surges through my body. I find it a strange sensation since I haven't felt any warmth in months. The minesweeper consumed me wholly, at 20 mines per minute. I was already pushing far beyond the limits of the human mind, I did not dare risk losing concentration. As the board is finally completed I can feel every one of the thousands of mines that have sweeped to bring me here, I can feel every click, every flag, every mouse movement. I find that after all this sweeping I have become one with it, I am the Son of the Minesweeping. My prize is to stand Among the gods, I am the right hand of the great Minesweepos. In this Fourth Dimension my mission is to promote the sweeping of mines, I must spread Minesweeping.
