Why conduits suck:
- Ugly
- Really bad for tps at large scales
- Destroy your fps for no reason (only thing worse for fps is conduit faÃ§ades)
- ME conduits are very glitchy, disconnect from ae2 blocks for no reason and can't connect to ae2 parts (what you should be doing most of the time)
- Very limited throughput, even with max upgrades
- GT pipes and ae2 exist
- Upgrades suck
- Shitty UI
- Spaghetti
