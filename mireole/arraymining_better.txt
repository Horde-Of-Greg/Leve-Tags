Array mining allows you to mine in huge straight lines. Tips and tricks:
- acquire a Zero-Point Module from loot and use an EIO sword with Direct found in the lost cities (in your offhand)
- get a void satchel and whitelist cobblestone/netherrack/endstone/etc.
- use GregTech hammers or drills and set offset to 3 for early 3xN mining
- get a few storage satchels for longer mining sessions
