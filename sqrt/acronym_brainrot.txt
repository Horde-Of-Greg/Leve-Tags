The state of losing touch with the real world as a result of consuming hyperstimulating or chronically online content, or the constant use of seemingly meaningless buzzwords ("skibidi", "among us", "pex", etc). Derived from the idea that one's brain would "rot" from consuming too much stimulating content.
