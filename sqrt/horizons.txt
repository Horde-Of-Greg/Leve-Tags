To be fair, you have to have a very high amount of free time to understand GregTech: New Horizons. The sheer time and Waiting required to even scratch the surface of UXV Tier (which yes, is the best thing ever made) is clearly far beyond your reach. The genius present in all of DreamMasterXXL's recipes is truly something to behold. You simple-minded mongoloids can’t begin to comprehend the references which are encrypted throughout the pack, with allusions to such things as ancient Chinese literature depicting the creation of Earth in UV tier (which is severly underrated). So don’t even try to critisize GTNH unless you can even come close to understanding it.
