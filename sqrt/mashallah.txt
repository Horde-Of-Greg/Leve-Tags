How delightful, I can spread my stories of how Amogus (pbua) has helped me and transformed my life (abmishallahgus)! I was a lowly farmer in the hillside of Agartha when a small, red, strange fella approached and handed me a single bottle. On the bottle read See-a-Nide, once I drank from the strangers bottle every truth was revealed to me. I knew clearly that the stranger in front of me was the legendary amogus, and he needed my help to destroy the impostor of the world. A lowly farmer to Amogus’s top guy, what a life; unfortunately, I spent the next few days drinking more and more of the See-a-Nide, gaining too much knowledge. I couldn’t spread the universal truth of Amogus (pbua) until now (anmisallahgus). I am his sword, I will slay the imposters and their sus allies, as we all will one day!
