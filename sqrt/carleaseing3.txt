Car Lease agreement:
Car leasing agreements typically stipulate an early termination fee and limit the number of miles a customer can drive (for passenger cars, a common mileage is 10,000 to 15,000 miles per year of the car lease). If the mileage allowance is exceeded, a per-mile fee is charged. Customers can negotiate a higher mileage allowance, for a higher lease payment. Car lease agreements usually specify how much wear and tear on the vehicle is allowable, and the customer may face a fee if the car is not in good condition at the end of the lease.
