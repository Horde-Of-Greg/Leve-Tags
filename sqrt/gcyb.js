        description: `PSA to GCY:S gamers from the GCY:Biology community

Recently a meme was shared to our subeddit outlining a dismissive and disrespectful act that, often, many non-GCY:Biology students are guilty of.

Please do not refer to Berkeley as "GCY:B." This is not the proper way to refer to the Gregicalities original and flagship campus. Biology, GCY:Biology or Gregicality:Biologyy are all proper and acceptable ways to say it. GCY:B, on the other hand, is not.

As the system's most prestigious and respected mod, we feel that it is important to honor and maintain an appropriate level of respect for our mod's name. We feel that "GCY:B" cheapens our brand and doesn't emphasize the incredible prestige associated with GCY:Biology.

While it may be acceptable to refer to all other GCY addons in initialisms due to their lack of recognition and prestige, this is not acceptable for the flagship and most well-known addon, and we therefore request that you cease using the name "GCY:B" to refer our school. Thank you.

TL:DR

Don't say "GCY:B" when referring to GCY:Biology.`
