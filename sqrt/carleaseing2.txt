For the leasing company, leasing generates income from a vehicle the car leasing company still owns and will be able to sell at auction or lease again once the original lease has expired. As consumers will typically use a leased vehicle for a shorter period of time than one they buy outright, leasing may generate repeat customers more quickly, which may fit into various aspects of a finance companyâ€™s business model.
