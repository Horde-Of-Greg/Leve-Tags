The Wait consumed me wholly, at 32 hours per day of GregTech I was already pushing far beyond the limits of Time, I did not dare risk losing concentration. As the Stargate is finally completed I can feel every one of the thousands of hours that have passed to bring me here, I can feel every tick, every piece of clay, every EBF recipe. I find that after all this time I have become one with it, I am the Son of the Wait. My prize is to stand Among the gods, I am the right hand of Chronos. At these New Horizons my mission is to promote the waste of time, I must spread Waiting."
