Rationale:
Car Leasing offers big advantages to customers. For the lease buyer, lease payments will usually be lower than payments on a car loan would be and qualification is usually easier. Some very cheap car leasing deals are available, but these change all the time. Some consumers may prefer leasing as it allows them to simply return a car and select a new model when the lease expires, allowing a consumer to drive a new vehicle every few years without the responsibility of selling the old car. Itâ€™s a very simple car owning solution. A car leasing customer does not have to worry about the future value of the car or vehicle, while a vehicle owner does have this nagging doubt.
