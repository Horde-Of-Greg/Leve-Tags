a spiraling descent into madness
a haunting specter at the corner of my periphery. i see vazkii, and he says "Quark."
i run and run, yet try as i might i cannot escape his ever-lingering presence. every corner i turn, he is there - "Quark." every modpack i seek refuge in, he is there. "Quark." 
i barricade myself in my room. chairs pressed up against the door at an angle. kept in darkness as i stare at the door, waiting - waiting.
he breaks down my door with a piston block breaker. "Quark," he says. "Quark," he says, as he draws closer.
