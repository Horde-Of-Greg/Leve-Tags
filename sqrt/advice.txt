Hello! not so new into the world of modded minecraft (still a newbie)  i like so much tech stuff and skyblock, tried so much packs, but all the modpacks i started i always dropped them on the early game or near mid, one of the pack i enjoyed is NTC2 (Not Too Complicated 2) but i found it too easy cause of the early projectE mod, the point is i would like to find a pack that is challenging, not boring and where i can learn mods too. I was thinking to start a project ozone pack, specifically the number 2, should i?
Any advices?
Thanks in advance.
