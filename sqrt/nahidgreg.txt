And then the Stargate asked Kharax, "are you star matter because you're magnetohydrodynamically constrained, or are you magnetohydrodynamically constrained because you're star matter?" Before Kharax could reply, the Stargate used Domain Expansion: Dimensionally Trascendent Plasma Forge, but unfortunately for the Stargate, Kharax was a user of Hollow Wicker Eye of Harmony, nullifying the domain's sure hit effect. Unimpressed, the Stargate simply remarked, "I haven't seen that technique since the Ludicrous Voltage era". In the meantime, Kharax uttered, "with this metastable oganesson, I summon", and suddenly, the Stargate's domain was shattered by Eight-Parallel Process, Divergent Vis, Divine Engineer Gregorius: the one who vaccuum froze it all behind, and his overwhelming industrialization. It was now a battle of the most polluting factory in history versus the most polluting factory of today. Gregorius told Kharax, "If the Stargate used its full EU/t, it might give me a little trouble". "But would you lose?" "Nah, I'd greg."
