GregTech New Horizons is a well known 1.16 kitchen sink modpack centered around exploring the wonders of Mekanism. It has many PvP aspects and exploring is encouraged to help advance in Botania and Astral Sorcery. The pack is generally considered a good beginner pack, as it has relatively simple recipes compared to many other packs, and reaching the final goal of creative vending is relatively easy. The pack used to be harder, but the developers saw new players struggling to complete it and decided to make it easier.
