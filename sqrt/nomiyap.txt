So like, everyone says Nomifactory is not that hard, and its a lot of fun, and like-
I can see it, I have fun sometimes and every time the grinding gets annoying I think just power through and maybe eventually once I get stuff made, get quests done and achieve certain goals like getting the enderio charger for the enderio items, I feel accomplished, but even just at the latter end of LV it's getting really exhausting 
There's so many recipes to memorize and complicated crafting involved for like anything, and its so hard to memorize and if you don't remember it, you have to dig and dig through the recipes to find the base materials, repeat if you forgot something, repeat after you make the base components to figure out how to put them together, etc, and you better batch craft which takes even longer with all the stuff you may have to get and arrange with that, otherwise you spend even longer later going back and forth between making components and making machines and such, just for one thing, and then theres a bazillion more things to do to one of the things you need for the next voltage level which involves a plethora of hunting down ore deposits and mining, so like my question is, is there something I'm missing or is this just not the modpack for me? Like what are a few things I could be doing wrong and what you can do to make it a bit easier and such? I feel like I could really have fun with this if I was playing right, there have been times where I have, and that I'm doing something wrong, but maybe I'm wrong and its just not for me, in which case please tell me
