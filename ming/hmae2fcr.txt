While the fluid pattern terminal requires EV assembler to make, you can achieve fluid crafting in nfu hard mode much earlier:
- Get a Fluid Discretizer and put it in your network
- you should now see drops in your network
- pull some drops out that you need in a recipes
- and encode them as regular items in a regular pattern terminal
  - use scroll wheel and shift+scroll wheel to increase / decrease count
  - 1 drop = 1L of fluid
