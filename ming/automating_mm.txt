Easy way to automate micro miners:

- Create an **AE2 pattern** that has your micro miners and other stuff as inputs, and has a named items as outputs (name it something recognisable like `tier one micro miner`)

- Put the pattern in the interface facing the input bus of your projector, put a **NAE2 autocomplete card** inside. So that AE2 doesn't wait for the outputs.

- request any amount of micro miners you need by middle clicking that item.
