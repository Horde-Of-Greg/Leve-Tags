Actually Additions **Item Lasers** might first seem a good way to move items around, but they have several critical flaws that makes them absolutely terrible:

- They disconnect randomly
- They are bad for FPS as the lasers are rendered differently
- They are a pain to configure
- They auto-push to nearby inventories which messes up most compact setups

If you were using them to automate the **Assembly Line**, consider switching to %t assline with a **AE2** based method. (oh yea lasers are recommended by questbook for some reason)
