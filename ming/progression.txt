when you don't know what to do to progress:
- read the quest book, nomifactory has a excellent questbook that explains it's progression well
- Improve on your existing infrastructure, e.g. getting more numis for power / upgrading your on demand machines to HV.

Avoid asking other people for suggestions on how to progress, because it is:
- a bit annoying
- they can't give good advice as they don't know what your base  is like
