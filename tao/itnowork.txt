There's no need to start looking for imaginary problems, this is what it could be listed by how likely they are to be the problem :

__Recipe not going__
1. No energy
2. Incorrect inputs (aka wrong items. Common issue : The soldering alloy needs antimony)
3. The recipe needs to be run inside of a cleanroom multiblock
4. Wrong tier of energy (LV, MV, LuV, etc.)
5. The Outputs of your mulitblock are full
6. Coils aren't hot enough (only for EBF/ABS/RHF)
7. Outputs aren’t big enough (common issue : liquid air distillation)
8. If it’s a GCYM, you need to switch its mode with a button inside the GUI 
9. It's in distinct bus mode and you're using two different buses
10. No maintenance hatch/maintenance not done
11. Muffler blocked by another block
12. It’s a bug with a known workaround
13. It’s a bug without a workaround (**very** unlikely)

Check up to 11. yourself before asking for more support. If it still doesn't work after checking all that, there's a good chance it's a bug

__Multiblock not forming__
1. You simply built it wrong overall, the shape isn't good, blocks are missing, etc.
2. You forgot an essential part of it (muffler, maintenance hatch, ...)
3. You forgot to place a block somewhere inside (check layer by layer in JEI preview)
4. You put inputs instead of outputs or vice-versa
5. The controller is not in the right place
6. You put too many energy hatches (check JEI preview for how many are allowed, usually 2 for normal multiblocks and 3 for GCYMs)
7. The energy hatches are not high voltage enough (only applies for specific cases like fusion reactor or Network Switch)
8. Cleanroom specific :
 - You have too many doors (the JEI preview tells you 8 but it's 4, cause each door is 2 blocks)
 - You have a "smoke producing machine" inside, like a turbine or a multiblock with a muffler
 - You placed plascrete inside of the cleanroom
9. It's bugged (**very** unlikely)

Check up to 8. yourself before asking for more support. If it still doesn't work after checking all that, there's a good chance it's a bug
