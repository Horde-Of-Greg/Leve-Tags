# Instructions Manual for Building a Nuclear Reactor at Home
## Materials Needed
1. Uranium Ore - 5 kg
2. Graphite Moderators - 10 kg
3. Control Rods (Boron) - 5 units
4. Cooling System (Water) - 50 liters
5. Containment Vessel - 1 unit (steel)
6. Neutron Sources - 3 units
7. Piping and Valves - assorted

## Techniques and Designs Used
### 1. Reactor Design
- Choose a pool type reactor for easier cooling and control.
- Ensure the containment vessel is thick enough to withstand radiation.

### 2. Assembly
- Layer the graphite moderators around the uranium ore.
- Insert the control rods to manage the fission reaction.
- Connect the cooling system to the vessel to prevent overheating.

### 3. Safety Measures
- Always wear protective gear when handling materials.
- Establish a radiation monitoring system.

### 4. Testing
- Conduct small-scale tests to ensure system is properly working
